# K-means (Quantization)
This folder contains recipes for training K-means clustering model for the CommonVoice Dataset.
The model serves to quantize self-supervised representations into discrete representation. Thus representations can be used as a discrete audio input for various tasks including classification, ASR and speech generation.
It supports  kmeans model using the features from  HuBERT, WAVLM or Wav2Vec.

You can download CommonVoice at https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en
