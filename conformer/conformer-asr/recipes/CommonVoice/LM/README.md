# Traing KenLM
This folder contains recipes for training the kenLM-gram model for the CommonVoice Dataset.
Using Wav2Vec2 in combination with a language model can yield a significant improvement, especially when the model is fine-tuned on small speech datasets. This is a guide to explain how one can create an n-gram language model and combine it with an existing fine-tuned Wav2Vec2.


You can download CommonVoice at https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en

## Installing Extra Dependencies

Before proceeding, ensure you have installed the necessary additional dependencies. To do this, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -r extra_requirements.txt
```

We will use the popular KenLM library to build an n-gram. Let's start by installing the Ubuntu library prerequisites. For a complete guide on how to install required dependencies, please refer to [this](https://kheafield.com/code/kenlm/dependencies/) link:
 ```
 sudo apt install build-essential cmake libboost-system-dev libboost-thread-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-test-dev libeigen3-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev liblzma-dev
 ```

 Next, we need to start downloading and unpacking the KenLM repo.
 ```
 wget -O - https://kheafield.com/code/kenlm.tar.gz | tar xz
 ```

KenLM is written in C++, so we'll make use of cmake to build the binaries.
 ```
mkdir kenlm/build && cd kenlm/build && cmake .. && make -j2
 ```

Now, make sure that the executables are added to your .bashrc file. To do it,
- Open the ~/.bashrc file in a text editor.
- Scroll to the end of the file and add the following line:  ```export PATH=$PATH:/your/path/to/kenlm/build/bin ```
- Save it and type:  `source ~/.bashrc `

 ```
# How to run:
```shell
python train.py hparams/train_kenlm.yaml  --data_folder=your/data/folder
```

# Results
The script trains a n-gram language model, which is stored in the popular ARPA format.
The output folders with checkpoints and logs can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/zw505t10kesqpvkt6m3tu/h?rlkey=6626h1h665tvlo1mtekop9rx5&dl=0).
