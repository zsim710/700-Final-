# Speech-to-Speech Translation (with CVSS)
This folder contains the recipe for training a speech-to-unit translation (S2UT) model using a pre-trained Wav2Vec 2.0 encoder and a transformer decoder on the CVSS dataset.
The implementation is based on [Textless Speech-to-Speech Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08352) and [Enhanced Direct Speech-to-Speech Translation Using Self-supervised Pre-training and Data Augmentatio](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02967) papers.

## Dataset
[CVSS](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/cvss) is a massively multilingual-to-English speech-to-speech translation corpus. It covers pairs from 21 languages into English. CVSS is derived from the Common Voice speech corpus and the CoVoST 2 speech-to-text translation corpus.
The CVSS dataset includes two versions of spoken translation: CVSS-C and CVSS-T. While both versions can be utilized to train the S2UT model, we recommend using CVSS-C because of its superior speech quality.

The first step is to select a source language and download [Common Voice (version 4)](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets) for the chosen language code. In this recipe, we've chosen French as the source language.
The next step is to pair translation audio clips with the source speech by downloading the corresponding subset of the [CVSS dataset](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/cvss). In our case, we have to download the French CVSS-C subset, which corresponds to the English translation of the French portion of the Common Voice dataset.

At this point, you should have two distinct folders: the first one containing the Common Voice data and the second one containing the CVSS data.

> Note: In the recipe, we frequently employ the terms `src_data` and `tgt_data`.
> `src_data` refers to the source language data (Common Voice).
> `tgt_data` refers to the target language data (CVSS).

## Installing Extra Dependencies
Before proceeding, ensure you have installed the necessary additional dependencies. To do this, simply run the following command in your terminal:
```
pip install -r extra_requirements.txt
```

## How to Run
Before training the speech-to-unit translation (S2UT) model, we have to quantize the target speech into discrete speech units. This is achieved by training a k-means model on raw speech features, which will then serve as the target for training the S2UT model. By default, we use a pre-trained model with `k=100` trained on the 6th layer of HuBERT. For instructions on training a new quantization model, please refer to `recipes/LJSpeech/TTS/quantization`.

To train the S2UT model on French-English, simply run the following command:
```
python train.py hparams/train_fr-en.yaml --src_data_folder=/corpus/CommonVoice/fr --tgt_data_folder=/corpus/CVSS/fr --bfloat16_mix_prec
```

>  Dynamic batch settings are optimized for a 40GB VRAM GPU. Don't hesitate to adjust max_batch_len and max_batch_len_val to fit your GPU's capabilities.

Training requires about 1 hour and 5 minutes for each epoch on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. A total of 30 epochs are needed.

To synthesize speech from the predicted speech units, you need to train a unit-based HiFi-GAN vocoder. If you haven't done this already, please refer to the `LJSpeech/TTS/vocoder/unit_hifi_gan` recipe.
