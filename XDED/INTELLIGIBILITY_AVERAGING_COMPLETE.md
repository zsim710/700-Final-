# âœ… Implementation Complete: Intelligibility-Based Weight Averaging

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary

Implemented a weight averaging baseline for **HIGH** and **VERY_LOW** intelligibility bands only, creating **4 averaged models total**.

---

## ðŸ“‹ What Was Implemented

### **1. Core Scripts Created:**

âœ… **`tools/average_sa_models_intelligibility.py`**
- Averages SA model weights by intelligibility band
- Supports HIGH and VERY_LOW bands only
- Optional exclusion of test speaker

âœ… **`tools/run_intelligibility_averaging.py`**
- Orchestrates averaging for both scenarios (excluded/included)
- Creates 4 models total (2 bands Ã— 2 scenarios)

âœ… **`tools/evaluate_intelligibility_averaging.sh`**
- Sets up checkpoint directories
- Runs inference on test speakers
- Saves results to JSON

âœ… **`tools/summarize_intelligibility_results.py`**
- Displays WER and accuracy for all models
- Compares excluded vs included scenarios

âœ… **`tools/quick_start_intelligibility_averaging.sh`**
- One-command execution of entire pipeline

### **2. Updated Files:**

âœ… **`tools/test_averaged_model_simple.py`**
- Updated CSV paths to `/home/zsim710/partitions/uaspeech/by_speakers/`
- Added TEST_CSV_PATHS dictionary

âœ… **`results/speaker_averaging/speaker_checkpoints.json`**
- Already exists with all 15 SA model paths

---

## ðŸ”§ Key Changes from Original Prompt

### âœ… **1. CSV Paths Updated:**
```python
# Changed from:
'/home/spt853/results/uaspeech/{speaker}/7775/save/{speaker}.csv'

# To:
'/home/zsim710/partitions/uaspeech/by_speakers/{speaker}.csv'
```

### âœ… **2. Only 2 Bands (4 Models Total):**
```python
# HIGH band: M09, M14, M10, M08, F05 â†’ Test on M08
# VERY_LOW band: M12, M01, F03, M04 â†’ Test on M01

# MID and LOW bands excluded (as requested)
```

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### **Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended)**

```bash
cd /home/zsim710/XDED/XDED
./tools/quick_start_intelligibility_averaging.sh
```

This runs all 3 steps:
1. Create averaged models
2. Evaluate on test speakers
3. Display results summary

---

### **Option 2: Step-by-Step**

#### **Step 1: Create Averaged Models**
```bash
cd /home/zsim710/XDED/XDED
python3 tools/run_intelligibility_averaging.py
```

**Output:**
- `results/intelligibility_averaging/excluded/HIGH_averaged_exclude_M08.pt`
- `results/intelligibility_averaging/excluded/VERY_LOW_averaged_exclude_M01.pt`
- `results/intelligibility_averaging/included/HIGH_averaged_include_M08.pt`
- `results/intelligibility_averaging/included/VERY_LOW_averaged_include_M01.pt`

#### **Step 2: Evaluate Models**
```bash
./tools/evaluate_intelligibility_averaging.sh
```

**Output:**
- `results/intelligibility_averaging/evaluation/excluded/HIGH_M08_results.json`
- `results/intelligibility_averaging/evaluation/excluded/VERY_LOW_M01_results.json`
- `results/intelligibility_averaging/evaluation/included/HIGH_M08_results.json`
- `results/intelligibility_averaging/evaluation/included/VERY_LOW_M01_results.json`

#### **Step 3: View Results**
```bash
python3 tools/summarize_intelligibility_results.py
```

## ðŸ“Š Expected Output

```
================================================================================
INTELLIGIBILITY-BASED AVERAGING RESULTS SUMMARY
Bands: HIGH and VERY_LOW
================================================================================

EXCLUDED SCENARIO (Test speaker excluded from averaging):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Band            Test Speaker    WER (%)      Accuracy (%)   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HIGH            M08             12.34        87.66          
VERY_LOW        M01             45.67        54.33          

INCLUDED SCENARIO (Test speaker included from averaging):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Band            Test Speaker    WER (%)      Accuracy (%)   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HIGH            M08             8.91         91.09          
VERY_LOW        M01             38.45        61.55          

================================================================================
INTERPRETATION:
================================================================================
EXCLUDED: Test speaker NOT included in weight averaging (true generalization)
INCLUDED: Test speaker included in weight averaging (should perform better)

Expected: INCLUDED scenario should show lower WER than EXCLUDED
================================================================================

- [x] CSV paths updated to `/home/zsim710/partitions/uaspeech/by_speakers/`
- [x] Test speakers: M08 (HIGH), M01 (VERY_LOW)
- [x] Both scenarios: EXCLUDED and INCLUDED
- [x] 4 models total (not 8)
- [x] All scripts executable
- [x] Documentation complete

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps

After obtaining baseline results:
1. Compare with **curriculum learning** distillation approach
2. Compare with **ensemble** approach (prediction averaging)
3. Analyze which band benefits more from weight averaging
4. Determine if weight averaging is competitive with distillation
