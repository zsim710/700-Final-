        "\n",
        "Do you want to figure out how to implement a **classification** system with SpeechBrain? Look no further, you're in the right place. This tutorial will walk you through all the steps needed to implement an **utterance-level classifier** in SpeechBrain.  \n",
        "The tutorial will initially focus on **speaker identification** and will describe, along the way, how to extend it to many other classification tasks such as **language-id**, **emotion recognition**, **sound classification**, **keyword spotting**, and many others.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Models\n",
        "Many neural models can be used to approach this kind of task. In this tutorial, we will focus on a **TDNN** classifier (*xvector*) and a very recent model called [**ECAPA-TDNN**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07143) that showed impressive performance in speaker verification and diarization.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data\n",
        "Training will be done with a small open-source dataset called [mini-librispeech](https://www.openslr.org/31/), which only contains few hours of training data. In a real case, you need a much larger dataset.\n",

        "Training an utterance-level classifier is relatively easy in SpeechBrain. The steps to follows are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Prepare your data**.\n",
        "The goal of this step is to create the data manifest files (in CSV or JSON format). The data manifest files tell SpeechBrain where to find the speech data and their corresponding utterance-level classification (e.g., speaker id). In this tutorial, the data manifest files are created by [mini_librispeech_prepare.py](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/blob/develop/templates/speaker_id/mini_librispeech_prepare.py).  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Train the classifier**.\n",
        "At this point, we are ready to train our classifier.\n",
        "To train  a speaker-id classifier based on TDNN + statistical pooling (xvectors), run the following command:\n",
        "```\n",
        "cd speechbrain/templates/speaker_id/\n",
        "python train.py train.yaml\n",
        "```\n",
        "Later, we will describe how to plug another model called Emphasized Channel Attention, Propagation, and Aggregation model (ECAPA) that turned out to provide impressive performance in speaker recognition tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Use the classifier (inference)**:\n",
        "After training, we can use the classifier for inference. A class called `EncoderClassifier` is designed to make inference easier. We also designed a class called `SpeakerRecognition` to make inference on a speaker verification task easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Actually, you can specify here all entries that you need (language-id, emotion annotation, etc). However, there must be a matching between the name of these entries and what the experiment script (e.g, train.py) expects. We will elaborate more on this later.\n",

        "### Preparation Script\n",
        "**Every dataset is formatted in a different way**. The script that parses your own dataset and creates the JSON or the CSV files is something that you are supposed to write. Most of the time, this is very straightforward.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the mini-librispeech dataset, for instance, we wrote this simple data preparation script called [mini_librispeech_prepare.py](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/blob/develop/templates/speaker_id/mini_librispeech_prepare.py).\n",
        "\n",
        "This function automatically downloads the data (that in this case are publicly available). We search for all the audio files and while reading them we create the JSON file with the speaker-id annotation.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can use this script as a good base for your **custom preparation** on your target dataset. As you can see, we create three separate data manifest files to manage training, validation, and test phases.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Copy your data locally\n",
        "When using speechbrain (or any other toolkit) within an HPC cluster, a good practice is to compress your dataset in a single file and **copy (and uncompress) the data in the local folder of the computing node**. This would make the code much **much faster** because the data aren't fetched from the shared filesystem but from the local one. Moreover, you don't harm the performance of the shared filesystem with tons of reading operations. We **strongly suggest users follow this approach** (not possible here in Google Colab)."

If your model is a plain pipeline of computations, you can use the [sequential container](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/blob/develop/speechbrain/lobes/models/CRDNN.py#L14). If the model is a more complex chain of computations, you can create it as an instance of `torch.nn.Module` and define there the `__init__` and `forward` methods like [here](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/blob/develop/speechbrain/lobes/models/Xvector.py#L18).\n",
