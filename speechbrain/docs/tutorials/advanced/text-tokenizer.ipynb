    "# Text Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why do we need tokenization?\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all languages have a huge number of possible words. Machine learning tasks that process text have thus to support large vocabularies that might contain several thousands of words.  Dealing with such a large vocabulary, however, is critical.  The input and output embeddings  (e.g. one-hot-vectors) are normally huge vectors, leading to and increase memory consumption and memory usage. More importantly,  learning with such extremely sparse and high-dimensional embeddings might be sub-optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "A naive alternative can be to simply use characters instead of words.\n",
    "The latter approach alleviates some of the aforementioned issues, but\n",
    "it requires processing a longer sequence  (that is critical as well from a machine learning point of view).\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we find a middle ground between words and characters? Yes, this is what the tokenizer is trying to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "One popular technique called **rule-based tokenization** (e.g. [spaCy](https://spacy.io)) allows splitting the text into smaller chunks based on grammar rules, spaces, and punctuation. Unfortunately, this approach is language-dependent and must be set for each language considered ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Another solution to get the best of both word-level and character-level tokenizations is a hybrid solution named **subword tokenization** relying on the principle that frequently-used words should not be split into smaller subwords, but rare words should be decomposed into meaningful (i.e. more frequent) subwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SpeechBrain currently relies on a custom integration of the [*SentencePiece tokenizer*](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) which treats the input as a raw input stream. The following tokenizer algorithms are supported:\n",
    "1. [BPE](https://web.archive.org/web/20230319172720/https://www.derczynski.com/papers/archive/BPE_Gage.pdf).\n",
    "2. [Unigram](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.10959.pdf) (Subword Regularization).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The *SentencePiece tokenizer* is available at `speechbrain.tokenizer.SentencePiece`. In the following, we will describe all the aforementioned techniques, but first of all, let's install SpeechBrain.\n",
