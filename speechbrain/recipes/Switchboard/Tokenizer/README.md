# Tokenizer
This folder contains the scripts to train a tokenizer using SentencePiece (https://github.com/google/sentencepiece).
The tokenizer is trained using the Switchboard training transcriptions and optionally the Fisher corpus.

You can download the Switchboard data at https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC97S62.

The eval2000/Hub5 English test set can be found at:
- Speech data: https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2002S09
- Transcripts: https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2002T43

Part 1 and part 2 of the Fisher corpus are available at:
- https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004T19
- https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2005T19

As in Kaldi's [swbd/s5c](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi/tree/master/egs/swbd/s5c) recipe,
the Fisher transcripts can be used as an additional resource for training Tokenizer and LM.
