# Language Model with KsponSpeech

This folder contains recipes for training language models for the KsponSpeech Dataset. It supports a Transformer-based LM.

You can download KsponSpeech at [Link](https://aihub.or.kr/aihubdata/data/view.do?currMenu=115&topMenu=100&aihubDataSe=realm&dataSetSn=123)

# How to run
Set tokenizer_file in the yaml files to the directory where the trained tokenizer is located. This is set to huggingface repository as a default.

Also, set data_folder in the yaml file to the result of ksponspeech_prepare.py.

Run the following to start training the language model.

```bash
python train.py hparams/transformer.yaml
```
