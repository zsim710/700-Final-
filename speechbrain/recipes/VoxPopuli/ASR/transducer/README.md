# VoxPopuli ASR with Transducers
This folder contains scripts necessary to run an ASR experiment with the VoxPopuli dataset;
Before running this recipe, make sure numba is installed (pip install numba) for faster training!
You can download VoxPopuli at: https://github.com/facebookresearch/voxpopuli

**We only report results for english but you simply need to download a different set to train with a different language!**

# Extra-Dependencies
This recipe supports two implementations of the transducer loss, see `use_torchaudio` arg in the yaml file:
1. Transducer loss from torchaudio (this requires torchaudio version >= 0.10.0).
2. Speechbrain implementation using Numba. To use it, please set `use_torchaudio=False` in the yaml file. This version is implemented within SpeechBrain and  allows you to directly access the python code of the transducer loss (and directly modify it if needed).

The Numba implementation is currently enabled by default as the `use_torchaudio` option is incompatible with `bfloat16` training.

Note: Before running this recipe, make sure numba is installed. Otherwise, run:
```
pip install numba
```

# How to run it
```shell
python train.py hparams/conformer_transducer.yaml
```

## Precision Notes
If your GPU effectively supports fp16 (half-precision) computations, it is recommended to execute the training script with the `--precision=fp16` (or `--precision=bf16`) option.
Enabling half precision can significantly reduce the peak VRAM requirements. For example, in the case of the Conformer Transducer recipe trained with Librispeech, the peak VRAM decreases from 39GB to 12GB when using fp16.
According to our tests, the performance is not affected.

# VoxPopuli non-streaming results

Results are reported with beam search but without any language model. Models are
trained with dynamic chunk training but decoding is offline.


| Language | Hyperparams file | Train precision | Dev-clean Greedy | Test-clean Greedy | Model link | GPUs |
|:-------------:|:---------------------------:|:-:| :------:| :-----------:| :------------------:| :------------------:|
| English | conformer_transducer.yaml `streaming: True` | fp16 | 9.80 | 10.18 | [Model link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/y2if76ut4xur5rg9sszj3/h?rlkey=y8wmip8bd06cb82vm2cvmfaz3&dl=0) |6x A40|

### WER vs chunk size & left context

The following matrix presents the Word Error Rate (WER%) achieved on the test set with various chunk sizes (in ms).

This is with greedy decoding only.

| lc=32 | -    | 10.88 | 11.39 | 12.37 |
